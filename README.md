Google Music player for iOS, because why not


I wrote this a while ago, long before google released their official app, since I figured I could put it up as a free alternative
to the paid app that was available at the time.

Finally decided to put it up here, it's messy, but it works reasonably well.


Supports lock screen controls, background playback, and browsing by song title and album.


This also serves as a good example of using my port of the Google Music API.
